- abstract: This paper presents and evaluates a new  multi-genre error corpus for
    (written) Esperanto, EspEraro, building on both learner, news and internet data
    and covering both ordinary spelling errors and real-word errors such as grammatical
    and word choice errors. Because the corpus has been annotated not only for errors,
    error types and corrections, but also with Constraint Grammar (CG) tags for part-of-speech,
    inflection, affixation, syntactic function, dependency and semantic class, it
    allows users to linguistically contextualize errors and to craft and test CG rules
    aiming at the recognition and/or correction of the various error types covered
    in the corpus. The resource was originally created for regression-testing a newly
    developed spell- and grammar checker, and contains about 75,000 tokens (~ 4,000
    sentences), with 3,330 tokens annotated for one or more errors and a combined
    correction suggestion. We discuss the different error types and evaluate their
    weight in the corpus. Where relevant, we explain the role of Constraint Grammar
    (CG) in the identification and correction of the individual error types.

  title: An Annotated Error Corpus for Esperanto
- abstract: 'Due to its reliance on context and intricate

    grammatical rules, the Romanian weak

    pronoun system presents a challenge not

    only for language learners – both native

    and non-native speakers – but also for linguistic

    description and computational processing.


    The present work addresses the challenges

    of Romanian weak pronouns from a computational

    processing perspective. Accordingly,

    it has three main goals: (1) to

    present the implementation of a rule-based

    model for generating contextually accurate

    surface forms of Romanian weak pronouns,

    (2) to describe the compilation of a

    database of relevant inputs for testing surface

    realization, and (3) to test the effectiveness

    of the model.


    This serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating

    both the transparency and the effectiveness

    of the model when based on an

    appropriate linguistic description.'

  title: Rule-based Surface Realization of Romanian Weak Pronouns
- abstract: 'This paper presents the application of rule-based methods for

    Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) across multiple low-resource

    languages. We describe new functionality using the Constraint Grammar

    (CG) formalism, designed for detecting and correcting different types

    of complex grammatical errors in a range of morphologically complex

    languages. These errors require transformations such as reordering,

    word additions/deletions, and alternative choices for multiword

    suggestions. New perspectives are gained from end-to-end-testing –

    this work aims to clarify the relationship between the command-line

    interface used by developers and the user interfaces of our grammar

    checker plug-in for common word processors. We discuss challenges and

    solutions in correcting complex errors, with examples from languages

    like Lule Sámi, Irish, and Greenlandic, enabling linguists to adapt

    these methods in order to provide accurate and context-aware proofing

    tools for their own languages in mainstream word processors like

    Microsoft Word, Google Docs or LibreOffice.'

  title: Drawing Blue Lines - What can Constraint Grammar do for GEC?
- abstract: This paper presents a general-purpose parser for static analysis of Constraint
    Grammar rules (that is, examining only the rules, not potential inputs and outputs)
    and applies it to the task of translating rules into comprehensible explanations
    of behavior. An interactive interface for exploring how individual components
    of each rule contribute to these translations is also presented.

  title: Towards Natural Language Explanations of Constraint Grammar Rules
- abstract: The article presents a finite state transducer and spellchecker for Mansi,
    an Ob-Ugric Uralic language spoken in northwestern Siberia. Mansi has a rich but
    mostly agglutinative morphology, with a morphophonology dominated by sandhi phenomena.
    With a small set of morphophonological rules (32 twolc rules) and a lexicon consisting
    of 12,000 Mansi entries and a larger set of propernouns we were able to build
    a transducer covering 98.9 % of a large (700k) newspaper corpus. Being a part
    of the GiellaLT infrastructure, the transducer was turned into a spellchecker.
    The most common spelling error in Mansi is the omission of length marks on vowels,
    and for the 1000 most common words containing long vowels, the spellchecker was
    able to give a correct suggestion as top-five in 98.3 % of the cases, and as first
    suggestion in 91.3 % of the cases.

  title: A Mansi FST and spellchecker
- abstract: This article will present a grammatical aunalyser, disambiguator and dependency
    analysis of Tokelau. The grammatical analyser is written as a finite-state transducer
    (FST), whereas the disambiguator and dependency analyser are written in Constraint
    Grammar (CG), both within the GiellaLT infrastructure. Contrary to most languages
    analyzed within this framework, Being a Polynesian language, Tokelau is a predominantly
    isolating language, with reduplication and affixation as the main morphological
    processes. The article will discuss how FST and CG deal with Polynesian languages.

  title: A grammatical analyser for Tokelau
- abstract: We investigate whether synthetic pretraining data generated from a formal
    grammar modeling syntactic dependencies can improve English language models. Building
    upon the structured pretraining data approach of Papadimitriou and Jurafsky (2023),
    we develop a grammar that more closely mirrors empirical dependency structures.
    Our results are negative – this type of pretraining significantly degrades model
    performance, with both our and their pretraining approach performing worse than
    no pretraining at all. We analyze potential explanations for these findings and
    discuss implications for future work on structured-data pretraining.

  title: Case error corrections for noun phrases containing deverbal attributive nouns
    in Greenlandic
- abstract: "Spell-checking and correction is one of the key applications of natural\
    \ language support.  \n    Historically, for the biggest, less morphologically\
    \ complex languages, spell-checking and correction could be implemented by relatively\
    \ simple means; however, for morphologically complex and low-resource languages,\
    \ the solutions were often suboptimal.\n    Finite-state methods are the state\
    \ of the art in rule-based natural language processing and also for spell-checking\
    \ and correction they have been effectively used.\n    In this article, we show\
    \ some recent developments of a finite-state spell-checker implementation that\
    \ works with modern operating systems and platforms."
